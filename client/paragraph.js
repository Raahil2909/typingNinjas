    "It is a love based on giving and receiving as well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving, we too can share and love and have... and receive.",
    "It takes more than a calorie of fossil fuel energy to produce a calorie of food. From the standpoint of industrial efficiency, it's too bad we can't simply drink the petroleum directly, because there's a lot less energy in a bushel of corn (measured in calories) than there is in the half gallon or so of oil required to produce it. Ecologically this is a fabulously expensive way to produce food.",
    `She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene. I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round?"

After a long search, we recovered the body. The sight made us dumb and tears trickled down our cheeks. The horrible sight still haunts me whenever I am alone.`,
    `There are some abuses of science. It has given us the frightful nuclear weapons that can destroy the whole world. But science cannot be blamed for this. We can use fire for cooking our food or burning otherâ€™s houses. It is not the fault of fire, but of its users. Likewise, man is responsible for the uses and abuses of science.`,
    `Exercise sharpens our intellect. It keeps a balance between our body and mind. With the help of regular physical training, we will stay healthier, happier, and more alert. However, over-exercise or exercising in an improper way may tell upon our health and growth. We must therefore do it in a balanced form.`,
